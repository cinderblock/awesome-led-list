## Contributing

If you have a product or resource you'd like to add, please submit a pull request.
You will need a GitHub account to do this.
Simple edits can be done easily directly in the GitHub web interface.
For more complex edits, you may want to use a text editor ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is our preference) and Git.
